# Life_expectancy_europe_africa

Nowhere is life expectancy higher than in Europe, new statistics from the World Health Organization show. 
Life expectancy increased significantly worldwide, except in Africa.

Extensive data analysis and prediction algorithms are used to uncover the reasons for the differences in life expectancy between countries.
Powerful statistical tools are used to seek valuable insights into the complex relationship between healthcare, socioeconomic factors and life expectancy.

This project is about analyzing life expectancy in some countries in Europe and Afrcia.
